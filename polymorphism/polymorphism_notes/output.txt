The program uses the class Animal to create the public virtual make_sound() method and the poke() func that calls make_sound() on an instance of an Animal. Then the program creates class Cow that makes_sound() 'moo' and class FullCow that makes_sound() 'Ooof - I ate too much". In main(), an instance of a Cow 'c' and an instance of a FullCow 'fc' are initialized and poke()d to output their respective sound.
