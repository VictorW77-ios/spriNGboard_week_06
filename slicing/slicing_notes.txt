The .main() func creates an a Cow object 'c', an Animal object ref '&cr', and an Animal object 'cs' that are both assigned to the value of 'c'. All three objects are poke()d. 'c' and '&cr' output the value of 'c' ("moo"), whereas 'cs' outputs the value of Animal's virtual make_sound() method ("I don't know how to make a sound!"). 'cs' seems to default to the virtual method in Animal since it isn't an explicit reference to the value of 'c'.
